# Blue_water_Baltimore
Lede project using BWB data and Baltimore City Open Baltimore data to understand where the streams and waterways are most polluted and the communities they are affecting.  

## Methodology

Using QGIS overlay the three data sets.

Using python understand what the chances are of the waterways being heavilly polluted given the income and racial concentration of the residents in any particular area of the city. 

Using visuals for the various pollutants and bacterium present in the streams, present the current states of the city's waterways over the years for which data was collected and allow the reader to understand the pollutants present in a particular aera/neighborhood.
